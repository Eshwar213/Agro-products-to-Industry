<br>Sesame – Horse gram – Chickpea.

<br>Rice / Potato – Sesame.

<br>Cotton – Sesame – Wheat.

<br>Sesame – Groundnut / Cotton / Maize<br>

<br><b><u>CROPPING SYSTEMS:-</u> INTER CROPPING:-</b>

<br>Sesame + Greengram (1:1)

<br>Sesame + Pigeonpea (2:1)

<br>Sesame + Soybean (2:1)

<br>Sesame + Cowpea (8:1)

<br>Sesame + Groundnut (1:1)
<br><b><u>SOILS :-</u></b>
Sesame comes up well on soils with slightly acidic (or) neutral reaction. It can be grown on
well drained soils and performs well in light loamy soils .
‡ It is highly sensitive to water logging.
‡ Very sandy, saline and alkaline soils are not suitable.<br>

<br><b><u>CLIMATE :-</u></b>
Sesame is essentially a tropical crop grown in arid and semi-arid areas.
It is generally cultivated in tropical and sub-tropical countries.
It’s main distribution is between 25 s and 25 N Latitudes
Its altitude range is normally below 1250 m although some varieties locally adopted up to
1500 m.<br>

<br>Generally, it requires fairly hot conditions during growth for optimum yield. Ideal optimum temperature for growth is 25-270 C .Extremely low temperatures of 10 C, there is a complete ceasing of growth. Temperatures >40 C seriously affect the pollination when there is less number of capsules. Sesame is a short day plant. High light intensity increase number of Capsules / plant.

<br><b><u>INFLUENCE OF RAINFALL:-</u></b>

Sesame is capable of with standing a higher degree of water stress. The crop can be grown entirely on stored soil moisture. A rainfall of 600- 1000mm results in optimum yield.<br>

<br><b><u>SEEDS AND SEEDING:-</u></b><br>

<br><b><u>SEED RATE:-</u></b>
Rainfed Irrigated
Under broadcasting (Kg/Ha) 6 5
Row seeding (Kg/Ha) 5 4
Mixed (or) Intercropping ‡ 1 Kg/Ha

<br><b><u>SPACING:-</u></b>
30 X 10 Cm in Andhra Pradesh (all seasons)
45 X 15 Cm is also recommended.<br>

<br><b><u>SEED TREATMENT:-</u></b>
Seed treatment with Thiram (3g/kg) is effective against seed borne diseases. Seeds may be soaked in 0.025% solution of Agrimycin- 100 for 30min. prior to seeding will minimize bacterial leaf spot.<br>

<br><b><u>SEASON – TIME OF SOWING:-</u></b>
Season Time
Coastal A.P. Kharif ‡ First fortnight of May.
Summer ‡ Second fortnight of January.
Telangana Kharif ‡ Second fortnight of July.
Rayalaseema Kharif ‡ May to June
Rabi ‡ Middle of January.<br>
<br><b><u>METHODS OF SOWING:-</u></b>
1. Broad casting is usually most widely used in all situations. Seed is mixed with sand in equal
quantities (or) 3 times to facilitate uniform distribution of yield. After sowing, seed is covered by shallow ploughing and planting by cultivators and harrowers<br>

2. Line sowing (or) Row seeding is done with seed drills to promote higher yields. Optimum depth of sowing is 2-3 cm.<br>

<br><b><u>MANURES $ FERTILIZERS:-</u></b><br>

<br><b><u>N-P -K REQUIREMENT :-</u></b>

Rainfed Irrigated
½ basal
N 40 60
P 60 60 ½ (30-35 DAS)
K 40 40<br>

<br>Application of sulphur @ 50 Kg/ha increases the yield if soils are deficient in
sulphur.<br>

<br><b><u>METHOD OF APPLICATION :-</u></b>
Placement of fertilizer at seeding using seed drills is more effective than broadcast
application.<br>

<br><b><u>INTEGRATED NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT:-</u></b><br>

Integrated nutrient management consisting of 5 t ha-1 of FYM, 40 Kg nitrogen, 20 Kg Phosphorous and seed treatment with Azospirillum has given encouraging results at several situations.<br>

<br><b><u>INTERCULTIVATION :-</u></b><br>
Sesame is sensitive to weed competition during the first 15-25 DAS. A minimum of two weedings, one after 15 DAS and another 35 DAS are required to keep the field relatively weed free. Row seeded crop facilitates use of blade harrows for intercultivation. Two intercultivations, 15 DAS and 35 DAS followed by one hand weeding keeps the field free of weeds.<br>

<br><b><u>WEED MANAGEMENT :-</u></b><br>
Use of Herbicides :-<br>
Herbicides use, especially under rainfed conditions, is very limited due to low yield, which may not compensate for the cost of herbicides. If necessary, Alachlor (1.0kg/ha) or Thiobencarb(2.0kg/ha) can be used as pre emergence spray for effective control of weeds. Use of pre emergence herbicides followed by one hand weeding around 30 DAS is the most appropriate way of weed management in sesame.<br>

<br><b><u>IRRIGATION:-</u></b><br>

Water requirement is 300-350mm. For rabi crop 5-6 irrigations are required.

<br><b><u>CRITICAL STAGES FOR IRRIGATION:-</u></b><br>
For rabi / summer sesame, a presowing irrigation is necessary for optimum seed germination
and adequate stand establishment. Flower initiation and capsule filling stages are most sensitive to water deficits.<br>

<br><b><u>SCHEDULING IRRIGATION :-</u></b><br>
Scheduling irrigations at 50% DASM is adequate. If irrigations are scheduled based on IW/CPE ratio, a ratio of 0.6 is optimum under most situations. Depending on soil type, weather conditions and crop duration, irrigations may be given once in 12 to 15 days. If irrigation water is not a limiting factor, flower initiation, maximum flowering and capsule filling results in optimum seed yield. Depending on the duration, sesame water requirement ranges between 350 and 450mm. The crop is usually irrigated by check basin method of irrigation.<br>

<br><b><u>HARVESTING:-</u></b><br>
Depending on the variety, sesame crop takes 80- 150 days for maturity. The crop is harvested when the leaves, stems and capsules begin to turn yellow and the lower leaves start shedding. To prevent shedding of seed, the crop should not become dead ripe in the field. The ripe plants are cut at the ground level carried to threshing yard, stacked for a week in the sun with the cut ends upwards.<br>

<br><b><u>QUALITY CHARACTERS:-</u></b><br>
Sesame is the oldest oil seed crop of the world. The seed has high food value because of the higher contents of good quality edible oil and nutritious protein<br>

<br><b><u>SEED COMPOSITION:-</u></b><br>

Sesame seed protein content varies from 20-28% with an oil content ranging between 48- 55%. Its mineral content is around 6%..

Among oilseed proteins, sesame seed proteins are more nutritious It is rich in methionine and tryptophane. Like other oil seeds, it is also deficient in lysine. The other limiting amino acids are thionine, isoleucin and valine. Sesame seed contains 21-25% carbohydrates, 1% calcium and 0.7% Phosphorous<br>

<br>Sesame oil has two constituents namely sesamin and sesamol. They are responsible for very high stability of oil at room temperature, and frying temperatures. The sesamin content ranges from 0.07 to 0.6%.
