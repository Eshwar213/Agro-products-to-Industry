<h2 class="heading">Cotton Cultivation</h2><br>
<p class="styling">
<b><u>Introduction about Cotton Farming :</u></b><br> Cotton is one of the most important fiber and cash crop of India and plays a dominant role in the industrial and agricultural economy of the country. Cotton is the most important fibre crop not only of India but of the entire world. It provides the basic raw material (cotton fibre) to cotton textile industry. Cotton in India provides direct livelihood to 6 million farmers and about 40 -50 million people are employed in cotton trade and its processing. Indian cotton production is heavily associated with the intensive use of hazardous pesticides. Data reveals that Cotton cultivation in India  consumes 44.5% of the total pesticides used in the country. In addition, cotton is a water thirsty crop and around 6% of the water for irrigation in India is used for cotton cultivation.Its seed (binola) is used in vanaspati industry and can also be used as part of fodder for milch cattle to get better milk.<br>

<br><b><u>The factors for the growth of Cotton in India are:</u></b>

    <br>Large favorable fertile Ganga Delta region,
    Plenty of cheap labor,
    Introduction of insecticide to kill Boll Weevils,
    HYV seeds like Sujata, Bharati.
    Introduction of favorable Fertilizer are good for the production of cotton.<br>

<br>Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, A.P. are the principle cotton producing states in India.<br>

<br><b><u>Types of Cotton:</u></b><br>

<b>a) <u>Long staple cotton:-</u></b> It has the longest fibre whose length varies from 24 to 27 mm. The fibre is long, fine and shining. It is used for making fine and superior quality cloth. Obviously, it fetches the best price. There has been rapid progress in the production of long staple cotton since Independence. About half of the total cotton produced in India is a long staple. It is largely grown in Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh.<br>

<b>b) <u>Medium staple cotton:-</u></b> The length of its fibre is between 20 mm and 24 mm. About 44 per cent of the total cotton production in India is of medium staple. Rajasthan, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra are its main producers.<br>

<b>c) <u>Short staple cotton:-</u></b> This is inferior cotton with fibre less than 20 mm long. It is used for manufacturing inferior cloth and fetches less price. About 6 per cent of the total production is of short staple cotton. U.P., Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab are its main producers.<br>

<b><u>Climate and Soil for Cotton Farming :-</u></b> Hot and moist climate is ideal for cotton farming. The climatic condition for cotton cultivation is mentioned below :<br>

<br>Seventy percent cotton is rainfed.  Clear sunshine and proper moisture level during boll formation is required. Moisture stress from 60 days to 120 days directly reduces the yield. More sunshine and warm humid climate favours the growth of the cotton crop. Low temperature at boll opening creates problem in harvest.<br>

    Temperature: 25°C is ideal for cotton cultivation.
    Rainfall: 150 cm to 200 cm rainfall is essential for cotton farming. Moisture in the wind is necessary.
    Soil: Irrigated cotton should be grown on medium black to deep black soil having pH range between 6 to 8. Saline soils are not suitable for cotton cultivation. Soil should have proper drainage. The depth of soil should not be less than 20 to 25 cm. It is advised to go for soil test before cultivating the cotton.<br>

<br><b>d) <u>Soil Preparation in Cotton Farming :-</u></b>  In Cotton Farming , the preparation of good flat bed is very important. This can be done by ploughing and disc harrowing. Ploughing should be followed by harrowing operation making the fine til soil particle. For advanced method of drip irrigation soil should be well prepared. Add 4 to 5 tons of well decomposed FYM or compost before last harrowing. In the soils having termites or white grub, add 750 to 1000 Kg/ha of Neem cake along with FYM.

<br>Improved and Hybrid varieties in Cotton :- For irrigated cotton the varieties from G. hirsutam species should be preferred. Also hybrids of Hirsutam x Hirsutam or Hirsutam x Barbadense may be preferred. There are number of varieties that are recommended for growing in India.<br>
<br><b><u>Region wise varieties in India are:</u></b>

    Northern Region : LH1134, LH1556, H-4, H-6, MECH-1 etc.
    Central Region : H-4, JKHY-1, H-6, PKV HY-2, NHH-44, MECH-1,
    SHAKTINATH, RCH-2
    Southern Region : DCH-32, Varlaxmi, Savita, Suvin, HB224, MCU5 etc.<br>

<b><u>Selection of Seeds in Cotton Farming :-</u></b> Only certified and tested seeds should be used for irrigated cotton. Delinted seed is preferred. 2.5 to 3 Kg seed per hectare should be used. Seed should be treated with Thiram or Bavistin. Extra seeds should be utilised for gap filling. Raise the seedling for gap filling in polybags. Fill the gaps during rainy season. Plantation in cotton farming between 7 to 8 thousands per hectare is optimum.<br>

<br><b><u>Plant Spacing in Cotton Farming :-</u></b> Under Micro Irrigation (MIS) Crop geometry may vary to economise the drip system. However optimum plantation per hectare of irrigated hybrid varieties is considered between 7000 to 8000 per hectare. Considering the soil type and varietal characters, spacing in pair row planting can be 2.5′ x 5′ x 5′ or 3′ x 4′ x 3′. Spacing of 4′ x 3′ (Heavy Soil) and 3′ x 3′ (Medium Soil) are adopted in Single row system.<br>

<br><b><u>Best Planting season in Cotton Farming :-</u></b>  Cotton should be planted before the onset of monsoon so that desired vegetative growth of the plant is achieved. Planting season varies in various regions.<br>

<br><b><u>Irrigation in Cotton Farming :-</u></b> Drip Irrigation is most effective way of watering in cotton farming<br>

<br><b><u>Main advantages of drip irrigation in cotton farming :</u></b><br>

<br>a) Drip Irrigation increases yield of cotton. On an all India basis an yield increase of 27% is recorded (INCID,1994). There are individual farmers cases where yield was doubled by drip irrigation when compared to the yield obtained under furrow / flood irrigation methods. Research into the reasons for such yield increases under drip systems has shown that – yield increases as the interval between water application is decreased even if the total amount of water applied is unchanged. During heavy fruiting mild water stress associated with intermittent irrigations triggered deterioration of the root system which is irreversible. Only high frequency, low intensity drip irrigation can prevent such cyclic water stress.<br>

<br>b) Drip irrigation makes it possible to grow cotton in all types of soils. Even in a light or shallow soil in which water storage is inadequate to supply the crop over an extended irrigation cycle as is the case with furrow or flood irrigation, drip irrigation provides an opportunity to raise good, high yielding cotton crop.<br>

<br>c) Because it eliminates intermittent water stress, drip irrigation allows the crop to approach its production potential for more days of the season thus resulting in higher yields.<br>

<br>d) Drip irrigation is suitable in any type of land / soil management system – flat, ridge and furrow, and bed and furrow systems.<br>

<br>e) Early planting and establishment of cotton crop is important as part of IPM and for high yields. Drip irrigation proves to be a boon in such situations, especially when the monsoon plays truant.<br>

<br>f) Drip irrigation results in early and uniform maturity of the crop and improved quality of kapas.<br>

<br>g) Because of the uniform distribution of water to each plant in the field the growth of plants will be more uniform.

<br>h) Application of water close to the rootzone keeps weed growth under control. It also reduces the incidence of pests and diseases as the foliage is not wetted and the dry canopy conditions are maintained.

<br><b><u>Intercultivation Operations in Cotton Farming :-</u></b> Timely weeding or use of weedicide will minimise the weed population. If soil preparation is properly done before sowing, then intercultivation with hoeing etc. should be minimum in drip irrigation. In pair row planting interspace between two pair rows can be inter-cultivated by small implements. Mulching can be done in irrigated cotton.<br>

<br><b><u>Fertilisers and Fertigation in Cotton Farming :- </u></b>The application of major nutrients like N, P, K and trace elements like iron, boron, magnesium, sulphur, zinc plays a vital role in cotton production. Balanced and timely application K gives better result. Though cotton does not appear to be an exhaustive crop, when grown intensively, high yielding varieties need abundant supply of available nutrients. Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium and Magnesium are the major nutrients essential for cotton. In India, experiment data reveals that on an average 100 – 125 Kg N, 60 – 75 Kg of P2 O5, 80 Kg of K2O per hectare are recommended. However, it is always advisable to calculate the N, P, K doses after soil analysis report. Under traditional fertilizer application, the entire dose of P & K are added as basal dose and Nitrogen into 3 – 4 split doses. Traditional fertilizer is to be placed well deep into 4 – 5 cm, below the soil near wetted area of the dripper.<br>

<br><b><u>Harvesting and Yield Of Cotton :-</u></b> Cotton can either be picked by hand or by machines. Manual picking is slow but better preserves fiber characteristics of cotton. Boll opening is the first action on the fiber which pushes fibers from the place where they were embedded for weeks before being exposed to the external conditions. The boll opening action is gentle and thus has no effect on the fiber quality. However, a longer stay of the open bolls in the field may change the color and also make the fibers shrink, thus affecting the three most important fiber characters, i.e. length, strength and micronaire. One character may be affected more than the other if there is a frequent dew. Such an effect cannot be eliminated as all bolls do not open at the same time and some open bolls have to stay in the field for days and sometime even weeks. In the case of hand picking, it is possible to pick open bolls at frequent intervals, and weather effects on the fiber, after bolls have opened, can be minimized. In China (Mainland) this effect is minimized as land holdings are so small that the majority of the growers who have planted cotton on about 1/10th of a hectare, can go many times to the field to pick few open bolls. In slightly bigger plots, fiber quality is preserved through a number of pickings during the season. 3-4 pickings/season are very common in many countries where cotton is hand packed.<br>

<br>Cotton yield depends on the management practices with the adoption of advance technology for growing cotton. Cotton crop can give 50-60 quintal/ha yield of kapas under drip irrigation.<br>

<br><b><u>Bottom Line :-</u></b> Initial Investment in cotton farming is high compared to other crops but profits also very high in cotton farming.<br>
